# NFT Staking project: Use Case 

## Time used

Total hours: 19.5 hours

## Experience during the project

The project was a very interesting experience as I was able to test my knowledge in the same project.

During the project I have had to face several difficulties, the most notable at the beginning of the project where I did not know how to implement the function by which the staking contract could accept several collections. At the beginning I ended up developing a version of the project that only allowed me to stake NFTs from a single collection. However, I managed to solve it by using different structures to store all the information. 

Another difficulty I have faced these days has been the creation of the tests. As a consequence of not being sufficiently familiar with their development and correct implementation.    

On the other hand, I found it very interesting to have the opportunity to develop the reward system under my own consideration. It allowed me to investigate these systems and create one that fits the requirements of the use case.

Finally, this use case has allowed me to get involved in it as if it were a personal project, which has allowed me to get involved during these 4 days in an intense and motivated way.
